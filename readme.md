# 🔍 Lyarinet Bash Script Network Scanner Result Viewer With Browser

This project provides a clean and responsive HTML interface to view network scan results exported as `scan_results.json`.

## ✅ Features

- 📊 Clean, modern table layout
- 📱 Responsive design with hover effects
- ⚡ Automatically loads JSON data via JavaScript

## 📁 Files

- `netscan.sh` – The scan Bash script 
- `index.html` – The HTML page for viewing
- `scan_results.json` – The scan data generated by your Bash script
- `scan_results.csv` – The scan data generated by your Bash script

## 🚀 How to Use
### 1. run bash
```sh
chmod +x netscan.sh
./netscan.sh
```

Follow the on-screen prompts:

1.  **Choose Network Interface(s):** Select one or more interfaces to scan. You can pick a specific interface by its number or choose `all` to scan across all detected interfaces.
    ```
    [1] eth0
    [2] wlan0
    [3] all
    Choose interface [1-2 or all]: all
    ```
2.  **Choose Scan Type:**
    *   **1) Standard (ping + nbstat):** This is the default comprehensive scan, ideal for general network discovery.
    *   **2) UDP port scan (top 1000):** Focuses on scanning common UDP ports on discovered hosts.
    *   **3) Listen for UDP multicast:** Enters a sniffing mode to capture multicast traffic for a specified duration.
    ```
    Choose scan type:
    1) Standard (ping + nbstat)
    2) UDP port scan (top 1000)
    3) Listen for UDP multicast
    Choice [1-3]: 1
    ```

Upon completion, standard and UDP scans will generate two files in the script's directory:

*   `scan_results.csv`: A comma-separated values file, easily viewable in spreadsheets.
*   `scan_results.json`: A JSON array of objects, suitable for programmatic parsing.

Multicast scans will generate `multicast_<interface_name>.log` files.

## 	Important Notes

*   **Root Privileges:** The script requires `sudo` because `nmap`, `tcpdump`, and `smbclient` often need elevated permissions for raw socket access and certain operations.
*   **DHCP Leases:** The script attempts to find hostnames from `/var/lib/dhcp/dhcpd.leases`. This path is hardcoded and may vary on different Linux distributions. If hostnames aren't appearing, verify this path.
*   **Security:** Be mindful when running network scanning tools. Ensure you have permission to scan the network you are targeting.

### 2. Generate your scan results:
Make sure your Bash scanner script outputs `scan_results.json` in the same folder as the HTML file.

### 3. Open in your browser:
```bash
firefox index.html
```
Or with any modern browser: Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.

### 4. Optional – Serve it locally:
```bash
python3 -m http.server
```
Then open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

## 🌟 Optional Features

- 🖼 **Dark Mode:** Ask to enable a dark theme
- 📦 **Self-contained HTML:** Embed JSON results directly in the HTML
- 🌍 **Web Dashboard:** Host on a server (Apache, Nginx, etc.) to access remotely

## 💡 Tip
Use the CSV file (`scan_results.csv`) for spreadsheet apps, and the JSON/HTML view for quick, portable browsing.
