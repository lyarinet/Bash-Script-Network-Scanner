# 🔍 Lyarinet Bash Script Network Scanner Result Viewer With Browser

This project provides a clean and responsive HTML interface to view network scan results exported as `scan_results.json`.

## ✅ Features

- 📊 Clean, modern table layout
- 📱 Responsive design with hover effects
- ⚡ Automatically loads JSON data via JavaScript

## 📁 Files

- `netscan.sh` – The scan Bash script 
- `index.html` – The HTML page for viewing
- `scan_results.json` – The scan data generated by your Bash script
- `scan_results.csv` – The scan data generated by your Bash script

## 🚀 How to Use
### 1. run bash
```sh
chmod +x netscan.sh
./netscan.sh
```

### 2. Generate your scan results:
Make sure your Bash scanner script outputs `scan_results.json` in the same folder as the HTML file.

### 3. Open in your browser:
```bash
firefox index.html
```
Or with any modern browser: Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.

### 4. Optional – Serve it locally:
```bash
python3 -m http.server
```
Then open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

## 🌟 Optional Features

- 🖼 **Dark Mode:** Ask to enable a dark theme
- 📦 **Self-contained HTML:** Embed JSON results directly in the HTML
- 🌍 **Web Dashboard:** Host on a server (Apache, Nginx, etc.) to access remotely

## 💡 Tip
Use the CSV file (`scan_results.csv`) for spreadsheet apps, and the JSON/HTML view for quick, portable browsing.
